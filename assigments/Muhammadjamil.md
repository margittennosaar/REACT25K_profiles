# About Me:

I am Muhammad Jamil, a seasoned professional with 18 years of experience, including 11 years in leadership roles at H&M Supply Chain. Throughout my career, I have contributed to various IT projects, such as the sustainable materials integration and Higg integration into H&M's website.

Beyond business development, I have also served as a lead trainer in 2016 for CASTO and OFS, H&M’s order management software. My expertise spans supply chain management, IT project execution, and leadership.

Currently, I am transitioning into software development and studying full-stack development at Helsinki Business College. I am eager to leverage my extensive business development and leadership experience to make meaningful contributions in the field of software development.
